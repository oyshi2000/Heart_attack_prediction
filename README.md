# Heart_attack_prediction

What is Heart Attack? 
    . A medical emergency which occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the heart
    . 19.6 million people die every year
    . Lifestyle is the main reason for this
Motivation?
    . To try to predict chance of heart attack in heart patients
    . To analyze different conditions that leads to heart attack
    . The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can alert the high-risk patients to make changes in lifestyle
Dataset:
    . Used dataset - Logistic regression - heart disease prediction (The dataset is publicly available on the Kaggle website)
    . From an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts
    . The classification goal - to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).
    . The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information - includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
